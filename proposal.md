# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Slot Machine Game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a random number slot machine game that will add up points when someone gets three of the same number. There will also be a change to get three hearts in a row that allows the player to get more points.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will be using visual basic and visuals to create the game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I do not plan on using another project. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I am not collaborating.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The player will earn points and score big or they will lose all their money.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will have a full slot machine game that doesn't run into any errors. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to have a well developed game that works perfectly. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is to start gathering visuals.
